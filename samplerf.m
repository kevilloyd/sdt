% many sample belief trajectories given optimal policy
%
% INPUTS
% ps: all possible beliefs
% T: transition matrix
% O: observation matrix
% a_opt: optimal policy
% start: fixed time step for signal to turn ON
% stopper: fixed time step for signal to turn OFF
% samples: number of samples
% interp: number of belief points to interpolate
% att_start: initial attentional state at start of trial (1=WEAK, 2=STRONG)
% p_decay: probability of decay to WEAK at start of next trial, even if
%               chose STRONG at decision state of previous trial
% lesion: if true, then all observations are generated as if always in weak
% attentional state, though not necessarily treated as such!
%
% OUTPUTS
% nicebel: average belief trajectory overall
% nicebel0: average belief trajectory for report 'no signal' 
% nicebel1: average belief trajectory for report 'signal'
% atts: average occupancy of STRONG state at each time step
% p_atton: probability of strong attention being engaged at all
% prs: proportion/probability of reporting 'signal'
