Code for https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.20.481204v1

Running the script `main` in Matlab will generate:
- A `mat` file containing the workspace value used to compute the results; and
- A range of figures for visualising those results

*Tested with Matlab R2020b and later*

See:
- **`main.m`** for the program entry point
- **`initialize.m`** for important parameter definitions
